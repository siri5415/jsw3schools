JavaScript has 8 Datatypes
1. String
2. Number
3. Bigint
4. Boolean
5. Undefined
6. Null
7. Symbol
8. Object

The Object Datatype:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The object data type can contain:

1. An object
2. An array
3. A date

Note:
~~~~
A JavaScript variable can hold any type of data.

The Concept of Data Types:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In programming, data types is an important concept.

To be able to operate on variables, it is important to know something about the type.

Without data types, a computer cannot safely solve this:

Example:
~~~~~~~
let x = 16 + "Volvo";

Note:
~~~~
When adding a number and a string, JavaScript will treat the number as a string.

Note:
~~~~~
When adding a number and a string, JavaScript will treat the number as a string.

JavaScript Types are Dynamic:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
JavaScript has dynamic types. This means that the same variable can be used to hold different data types:

let x;
x =2;
x = "Siri"


JavaScript Strings:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A string (or a text string) is a series of characters like "John Doe".

Strings are written with quotes. You can use single or double quotes:


You will learn more about strings later in this tutorial.


JavaScript Numbers:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
All JavaScript numbers are stored as decimal numbers (floating point).

Numbers can be written with, or without decimals:

Note:
~~~~
Most programming languages have many number types:

Whole numbers (integers):
byte (8-bit), short (16-bit), int (32-bit), long (64-bit)

Real numbers (floating-point):
float (32-bit), double (64-bit).

Javascript numbers are always one type:
double (64-bit floating point).

You will learn more about numbers later in this tutorial.

JavaScript BigInt:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
All JavaScript numbers are stored in a a 64-bit floating-point format.

JavaScript BigInt is a new datatype (ES2020) that can be used to store integer values that are too big to be represented by a normal JavaScript Number.


JavaScript Booleans:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Booleans can only have two values: true or false.

Booleans are often used in conditional testing.


JavaScript Arrays:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
JavaScript arrays are written with square brackets.

Array items are separated by commas.

Array indexes are zero-based, which means the first item is [0], second is [1], and so on.

The typeof Operator:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can use the JavaScript typeof operator to find the type of a JavaScript variable.

The typeof operator returns the type of a variable or an expression:



Undefined:
~~~~~~~~~~
In JavaScript, a variable without a value, has the value undefined. The type is also undefined.


Any variable can be emptied, by setting the value to undefined. The type will also be undefined.

Empty Values:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
An empty value has nothing to do with undefined.

An empty string has both a legal value and a type.
