// Variables defined with var are hoisted to the top and can be initialized at any time.

// carName = "Volvo";
// var carName;
// console.log("The result of the carName :" + carName);


// Variables defined with let are also hoisted to the top of the block, but not initialized.

// Meaning: Using a let variable before it is declared will result in a ReferenceError:

carName = "volvo";
let carName;
console.log("The result of the carName " + err);
